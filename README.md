## Build instructions
- 3D print the LED holder using the [provided CAD model](CAD). Remove print supports.
- Laser cut the acrylic sheets using the [provided CAD drawings](CAD). Remove protective film.
- Finish cutting the corrugated plastic with the help of a utility knife, if needed.
- Peel the adhesive backing from the LED connector and attach it to the wide space of the LED holder, with the screw terminals facing out.
- Peel the adhesive backing from the LED strip; connect the LED strip to the LED connector -making sure to match the polarity and attach it to the narrow space of the LED holder.
- Connect positive and negative sides of the LED connector to the positive and negative sides of the DC adapter (respectively). Optionally, add a 50 to 200 Ohm resistor in series with one of the two LED cables to dim the lights.
- Assemble all acrylic parts (except for the roof) using painter's tape and apply acrylic cement or 2-part epoxy. Remove painter's tape after drying.
- Use Cyanoacrylate to attach the LED setup to the removable lid.
